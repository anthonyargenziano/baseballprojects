# baseballprojects

Hello, I'm Anthony Argenziano, and I'm an MBA student at Yale School of Management, and recent 2020 graduate of Columbia University, where I majored in economics and statistics.

This repository houses my baseball-related projects, analyses, and papers. I mostly utilize R, however have experience writing basic programs in Python, as well as with writing queries in SQL. I will continue to add projects as I perform them.

I'm excited to share my work in this repository and it branches. If you have any questions about my work, please feel free to reach out to me at asa2176@columbia.edu, and I would be happy to discuss.
