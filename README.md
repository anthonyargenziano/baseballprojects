# projects

Hello, I'm Anthony Argenziano. I'm an MBA student at Yale School of Management, and recent 2020 graduate of Columbia University, where I majored in economics and statistics.

This repository houses my baseball and sports-related projects, analyses, and papers. I mostly utilize R, however have experience writing queries in SQL and took an introductory Python course. I will continue to add projects as I perform them.

I'm excited to share my work, and would appreciate any feedback or follow-up. If you have any questions about my work, please feel free to reach out to me at asa2176@columbia.edu, and I would be happy to discuss.
